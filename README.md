# SPM-Project

Hi this a project that I have done in GitLab for Software Project Management with my teammates where we were tested on Agile Development process. The aim of the project is to create a learning managment system & we were not expected to finish it.We developed this website with CI/CD pipeline using GitLab runners & Azure App service  

This website is created using .Net Framework with C# Async code & jQuery

This website also uses .Net Idenity for Authentication + Datatable jQuery library to display information
